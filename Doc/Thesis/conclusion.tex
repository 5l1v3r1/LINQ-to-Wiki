The goal of this work was to implement a C\# library to access the MediaWiki API
in a way that is readable, discoverable, strongly-typed and flexible.

These goals were successfully accomplished using a custom LINQ provider and code generation with Roslyn.

The actions available through the LINQ provider closely match those that are available from the API
by intentionally not supporting all LINQ operators, and using different set of properties for each operator.
